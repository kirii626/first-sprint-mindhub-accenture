# Hi, I'm Kiara! 👋

Welcome to the **first activity** for the **first sprint** of the **Immersive Java Bootcamp** by **MindHub**, conducted at **Accenture**.

## 📝 What is this activity about?

In this exercise, you'll create simple **GET endpoints** that greets our user or take the data you'll pass at the url.  
They are implemented with a basic **servlet**, and you can test them easily by running the code and accessing the path in **Postman**.

---

## 🚀 How to Test It

1. Run the code.
2. Open Postman.
3. Make a **GET request** or **POST request** to the specified path.
4. 🎉 See the output message in the response!
